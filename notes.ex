What problem are we solving?
We are building a form information tracker.
We are not building a form information tracker.
We are building a cart! :DDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!! :)))))))

ShoppingCart
  Core Functionality

    Events:
      Add to Cart
      Remove from Cart
      -> but this doesnt really remove it from cart, it makes a new entry saying that it's removed

    What gets added to the cart?
    Items!
      What does an item have?
      quantity, price, name
      
    Outputs:
    core outputs
    1) is a list of all Events
    2) whats actually in the cart now
    3) total price (or calculate on your own)


    awesomeness outputs
    4) what are all the things that were removed from the cart?
    5) ...


    This was put in, this was taken out...

Programming goal...



We may want to use tuples for the stuff in the cart.

If we really get awesome!!!
  An ability for a user to save an item for later.
